Rocket is my first real attempt at making a project for my resume. It is a 2D game with a similar gameplay style to a platformer where the player controls a rocket
and can move it up or down with the spacebar to avoid incoming attackers. The attackers change with each wave and start out more simple and become more advanced and
difficult to avoid. In the first wave the possible attackers are a police car that follows a linear path along the ground, a heli that vertically seeks the player and
an uncontested fuel can which gives bonus points. The second wave keeps the previous enemies but adds a pogo which bounces up and down on its way across the screen.
The third wave removes the police car from the enemy pool and adds a missile strike that warns where it is about to strike a couple seconds before it comes down from
the sky.

MAIN TAKEAWAYS:
I learned a lot about game design and how important proper planning is to actually get the product to an acceptable state. Most of the time I spent working on this
was during the lecture for my Intro to Computer Science class since I already knew Java well enough that I didn't need to study or pay much attention. Overall
my greatest takeaway from this project is that Java Swing sucks to develop on and it is very out of date. I think if I really wanted to I could've made the UI much 
better looking, however I felt like the time investment was just not worth it especially since Swing is so rarely used by major companies.
